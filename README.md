## Treasure Hunting Game  

A **Java console application** where players explore a grid-based map, search for treasure, and avoid traps.  
This project demonstrates:  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles (encapsulation, classes, methods)  
- **User interaction** through a **full console-based application** (menu navigation, player input, and dynamic feedback)  
- **Randomized gameplay** using Java's built-in libraries  
- **Clean code practices** with comments and structured methods  

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in an IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)  
3. Compile and run `TreasureHuntingGame.java`  
4. Play directly in the **console window**
